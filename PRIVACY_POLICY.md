# Privacy Policy for Future Tools

**Last Updated:** January 4, 2026

## Overview

Future Tools ("the Extension") is a browser extension that helps you save webpage URLs and titles to your personal Google Sheet. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

### What We Access (Temporarily)
When you click to save a page, we access:
- Current page URL
- Current page title
- Your optional notes

This data is **immediately sent to YOUR Google Form** and is NOT stored by us.

### What We Store (Locally)
- Your Google Form URL
- Your custom sheet name

This is stored using Chrome's local storage on YOUR device.

### What We Do NOT Collect
- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Analytics or usage data
- ❌ Cookies or tracking data
- ❌ Any data to our servers

## Data Flow

```
You → Extension → YOUR Google Form → YOUR Google Sheet
```

We are NOT in this flow. Your data goes directly from your browser to Google's servers (your own Form/Sheet).

## Third-Party Services

The extension submits data to Google Forms, governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Permissions

| Permission | Why We Need It |
|------------|----------------|
| `activeTab` | To get the current page's URL and title when you click save |
| `storage` | To remember your Form URL locally |

## Your Control

You can:
- **Reset** all settings anytime from the Settings page
- **Uninstall** the extension to remove all local data
- **Delete** entries from your own Google Sheet
